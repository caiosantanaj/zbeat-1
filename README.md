# zbeat
video caller assistant for the blind and visual unpaired people
Alexandra Costa , Caio Santana, Cristiana Oliveira, Mário Vairinhos 


ZBeat uses Microsoft’s Azure for a video assistance tool that helps blind people to understand other people’s mood in a videocall. It functions as an assistant(bot), which analyses the facial expression of the person talking, and translates it to a song that corresponds to a certain emotion.
We hope to enhance the video chatting experience for blind people, as well as friends and family, through the introduction of body language in their interactions.

USAGE

2- open skype or any other video call software on the top of the desktop

emotions avalailable:
